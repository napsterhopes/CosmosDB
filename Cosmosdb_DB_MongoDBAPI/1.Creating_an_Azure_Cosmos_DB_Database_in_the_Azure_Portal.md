n this Lab Step, you will create a Cosmos DB database that supports the MongoDB API. To create the database, you will first create a Cosmos DB account that holds databases of a specific model and API type. The account acts as a container for databases and is referred to as a container in some documentation.

#### Instructions
1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure Portal, enter cosmos. Click Azure Cosmos DB under Services.
2. Click + Create to create a new Cosmos DB account.
3. Select Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB as the API selection.
4. In the Basics tab of the Create Azure Cosmos DB Account blade, enter the following values leaving the defaults for any fields that are not specified:

Resource Group
Account Name
API: Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API
Apply Free Tier Discount: Do Not Apply
Location: West US
Geo-redundancy: Disable (You will geo-replicate the data later in the Lab) 

By default, databases in a Cosmos DB account are accessible over the internet. The **Virtual networks** tab contains settings that allow you to configure the Cosmos DB databases to be only accessible from within an Azure virtual network or specific subnets. You won't need that functionality for this Lab.

5. Click Review + create, then click Create.
The account is ready once you see the Your deployment is complete message.

6. Click Go to resource to open the Quick start blade for the account

The Quick start blade gives sample code for various drivers to connect to the MongoDB database. At this point, there is only the default MongoDB admin database used for managing users and access.

7. Click **Overview** in the Cosmos DB Account blade.
The **Overview** shows all of the **Collections** in the account and a few visuals:

A collection is where documents are stored in a document database. 
There are no collections until you create one. 
The Overview has visuals for which region the account is configured to use and monitoring graphs for the **Number of requests** and **Request Charge**. 
In Cosmos DB, you are charged for the amount of storage you use and the number of request units (RU).
RUs are a way to normalize the amount of work required to fulfill a request. 
1 RU = Reading 1KB of data. 

More complex operations use up more RUs. 
The **Request Charge** graph can help you diagnose if you need to provision more throughput. 
You would notice a flat line at the maximum value if you are consuming all of the available RUs. 
There is no built-in automatic scaling of RUs as of June 2018, but you can configure the amount of RUs provisioned at any time.

8. Click on Data Explorer.
The **Data Explorer** is where you can configure databases and collections in the Azure Portal.

9. Click New Database to create a database in the account:

10. In the New database form, set the following values before clicking OK:

Database id: stocks
Provision throughput: Unchecked

You will store fake stock ticker data in the database. The Provision throughput setting allows RUs to be shared across multiple collections in a database compared to setting the number of RUs available to each collection in the database. Provisioning throughput is useful when you have many collections and do not require a guaranteed throughput level for any collection. Provisioning throughput can help respond to unexpected spikes in any particular collection. You will only use one collection in this Lab, so there is no need to provision throughput.

After a few seconds the database appears in the Data Explorer:

11. Hover over stocks and click ellipsis (...) > New Collection to open the form for adding a collection in the Azure Portal:
