The remaining Lab Steps require a shell to issue Azure CLI and MongoDB commands. You will use Azure Cloud Shell for this purpose. Azure Cloud Shell is a shell that runs in your web browser. Cloud Shell comes with several tools installed that are useful for managing resources in Azure, such as the Azure CLI. You can choose between a Linux-style Bash shell or a PowerShell experience. You can switch between the two shell experiences at any time. Cloud Shell is backed by an Azure file share that persists a clouddrive home directory. The shell runs on a temporary host that is free to use. You only pay for the required file share storage.

Some points worth noting are:

- You are a regular user without the ability to obtain root/administrator privileges. 
- The cloud shell will timeout after 20 minutes of inactivity.

Instructions
1. Click on the >_ Cloud Shell icon in the menu bar of the Azure Portal Dashboard:

This will open a Cloud Shell console at the bottom of your browser window.

2. Select Bash for your shell experience:

3. Click on **Show advanced settings** to configure the shell to use existing storage resources:

4. Set the following values in the Cloud Shell storage configuration form, and then click Create storage:

**Subscription:** Leave the default value
**Cloud Shell region:** Choose the South Central US region (The Cloud Academy Lab environment created a storage account for you in this region.)
**Resource group:** Choose Use existing. Select the resource group beginning with cal-
**Storage account:** Choose Use existing. Select the only storage account available or the one beginning with cacloudshell if there are multiple
**File share:** Choose Create new. Enter cloudshell for the name of the file share

#### Why does a cloud shell requires a storage account?
The reason for that Storage Account is to persist the scripts, keys, etc that you'll use over and over as you interact with your resources.

The file share creation should complete within a few seconds, and your Cloud Shell will display progress as it initializes.

5. Wait until you see the prompt ending with $ indicating your Cloud Shell is ready to use:
